# Project Description

Develop a web application that allows users to calculate and compare the value of NBA draft
picks in potential trade scenarios. Ideally this tool would be used to assist decision makers in
creating or evaluating trade concepts involving draft picks.

**Example Usage:** Visualizing and evaluating the following trade:<br>
● Team A receives: Team B’s 2026 1st round pick<br>
● Team B receives: Team A’s 2030 1st round pick + Team A’s 2030 2nd round pick

# Core Requirements

1. Allow users to build scenarios where (at least 2) teams exchange draft picks
2. Evaluate and display whether a trade is balanced or favors one side
3. Allow users to save trade concepts so that they can be compared to other concepts
4. Implement a system to value each draft pick<br>
    a. You may simply use one of the value charts [here](http://nbasense.com/draft-pick-trade-value/2/kevin-pelton-2) if you would like. Additional complexity is optional.<br>
    b. You will mainly be evaluated on the functionality of the trade tool itself, not on the value system you implement

# Submission Instructions

Please submit the following:<br>
● A link to the complete source code via GitHub repository<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;○ You are free to choose what you believe to be appropriate languages/frameworks<br>
● Deployed working version of the application (if possible)<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;○ Include a link to this in the README file on GitHub<br>
● Clear setup instructions (if needed)<br>
● Brief documentation explaining implementation choices<br>
● Notes on any future enhancements you would like to add<br>

# Evaluation Criteria

● Functionality and adherence to the core requirements<br>
● Code quality and organization<br>
● User experience and interface design<br>
● Technical choices and implementation<br>


# Additional Resources + Notes


● You can read more about how the NBA Draft works [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft). The Trades section may be of
particular relevance.<br>
● We recommend allocating no more than ~8 hours to complete this project.<br>
● By continuing with this project and the interview process, you acknowledge that this project and the resultant web app will remain confidential unless otherwise expressed by us. We are happy to work with you to include this project as part of your portfolio after the interview process if you would like.
